      <h1>Irish Food</h1>
    
       <p>When you think of Ireland, you might think of beautiful green hills, ancient churches, and a warm, welcoming culture. But no journey to the Emerald Isle is complete without exploring its rich traditional foods. Irish food is rooted in simplicity and locally-sourced ingredients, reflecting the island's agricultural history. Whether you’re savoring a pint of Guinness with a stew or enjoying a hearty breakfast, traditional Irish cuisine offers an authentic taste of all that Ireland represents, home.</p>

            <div class="p-2"><h4>Fish and Chips</h4>
                             <p>Everyone has definitly atleast heard of the wonder that is fish and chips. It is a classic in many places but it is an Irish delicacy. Incase you havn't tried it before, the dish cosisits of some sort of white fish (usually cod) which is dipped in batter and deep fried and a side of chips. Due to Irelands geography, the quality of fish they can catch is unmatched with the flavours just melting away in your mouth. And of course the famous Irish potatoes makes an even better chip! This meal should definitly be one for the bucket list.</p>

            <div class="p-2"><h4>Coddle</h4>
                             <p>Taking it back now to this all time classic, coddle. If you were to ask any Irish person what is the most traditionally Irish food you can think of I guarantee an overwhelming majority would say this. Coddle is the type of meal your Mam would make for you when there's nothing left in the fridge so it is essentially a mix of a lot of differnt ingredients and flavours. It is a type of stew for lack of a better word. The main components are potatoe, cabbage, and some kind of sausage. If you are looking for a very authetic Irish dinner coddle is the way to go.</p>

            <div class="p-2"><h4>Spice Bag</h4>
                             <p>Last but most certainly not least we have the spice bag. The spice bag is probably the most popluar thing from what has been talked about so far. It is truley the go-to of every Irish person after a long night out on places like Candenm st. and Georges' st.. If you have never tried a spice bag you are missing out! It consists of fried chicken, vegtables like peppers and onions, some spices and chips. Although this might seem a bit of an odd choice to bring up when discussing traditional Irish food, but the spice bag really has inbedded itself in Irish culture and it is a must-have when in Ireland.</p>
