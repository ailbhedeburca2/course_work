/*You are implementing a simple patient queue system for a small clinic. Each patient in the queue has the following information:

ID (an integer, assigned automatically starting from 1 in the order they appear in the input)

Name (a string, you can assume maximum 50 characters)

Priority (an integer between 1 and 5, where 5 is the highest priority)

Write a program ex2-patient-queue.c[✓] that:

Accepts the number of patients and their details (name and priority) as command-line arguments.

Assigns IDs automatically in the order they are inserted into the list (starting from 1).

Displays the full queue in the order of arrival in the following format ID: <id>, Name: <name>, Priority: <priority>

Counts and displays how many patients have priority 4 or 5 (high priority) in the format High priority count: <number> */
